Needed steps with brief descriptions:

1- Installing Django Rest Framework
2- Create Django Project 
3- Create an "App". # Apps are individual pieces of logic that'll allow us to compartmentalize 
                    # all the different things that our project is going to do, as well as keep ieces of project grouped together.
4- Create Models and Serializers testing
5- DRF Database migrations and serializers testing. # Django migrations automatically defines SQL tables for our models. 
                                                    # So, the Fields defined in model are mapped to Columns in the SQL table. 
                                                    # "So whenever we create a new model or change an existing model, 
                                                    # we will do a simple migration and Django will create python scripts for 
                                                    # migrations which we can store in your source repo for tracking DB changes 
                                                    # over time and itâ€™s helpful for our code update in production."
6- Creating Views
7- Browsable API
8 YASG Customization

Moving forward, coordination with Martin and Adam is vital.
